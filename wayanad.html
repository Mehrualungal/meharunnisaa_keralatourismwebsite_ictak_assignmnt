         <h5>Best Time To Visit</h5>
         <p>
            The temperature in Wayanad remains more or less constant throughout the year, but the best time to visit Wayanad is between October and May. These months covers the winter and the beginning of the summer season. During the monsoons, the hill station receives the right amount of rainfall and the wet and humid weather might not be something tourists would be crazy for. So it is not always recommended except for those who wouldn't mind the rains only to be amidst the beautiful hill station covered with a green carpet of dense trees.
