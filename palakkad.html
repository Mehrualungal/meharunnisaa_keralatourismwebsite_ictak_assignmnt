            The quaint town of Palakkad in central Kerala boasts of picturesque landscape, tranquil scenery and clear backwaters. Also known as Palghat, Pallakad is located near a wide low pass in the Western Ghats mountain ranges. Palakkad is the land of Palmyras and Paddy Fields and is famous as the chief granary of Kerala.

            Palakkad gets its name from pala trees which once dominated the area. This is the area which links Kerala to Tamil Nadu and perhaps does so in a cultural sense too, since the language spoken in the villages here is Tamil, unlike the rest of the state where Malayalam is prevalent. 
            
            Palakkad is known for the ruins of Tipu Sulthan's Fort, four dams and one of the first amusement parks of Kerala - Fantasy Park. Some other locations that can be visited in the area include the Palakkad Fort, Silent Valley National Park, Pothundy Dam, Jain Temple, Dhoni waterfalls, Walayar Dam etc.
